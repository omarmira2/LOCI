## LOCI, building a future where anyone can become an expert developer or tester and create reliable, high-quality software.
‚ú® First launch, LOCI for Refactoring.
AI and Machine Learning help understand coding patterns better and suggest more intelligent refactoring changes that adapt to the project or developer's coding style.

## Privacy
What is yours stays yours; you can learn more about our privacy and responsible AI at www.loci-dev.com/privecy

## Under the hood
‚ú®LOCI uses our built-in, proprietary Large Code Language Model (LCLM), a TRANSFORMER model based on our layers. It has been trained on over 
5 billion lines of code in C and C++, creating billions of new tokens, making AI-based refactoring real and reliable.

‚ú®Maximum qualified advice for software refactoring is provided through reinventing vocabulary, training, tokenizers, and error prediction engines.

‚ú®It is compatible with Visual Studio version XX or higher and GitHub.

## What can you do with LOCI today?
Like Shazam for music, LOCI listens to your music==your software lines of code and identifies similarities, which indicate cloned or redundant code.

## ‚ú® Full Transparency of the Redundant Code 
Scan snipped code, part of a function, and LOCI, Like Shazam for Music, but for SW lines of code will display the list of Cloned, redundant code segments in your project and Repos.

## ‚ú® Automatically Refactoring Code According to Your Style

## ‚ú® Fix Manually in one time, one place and apply for all other similar segments
This will reduce software maintenance and bug-fixing time by 20-30%.

This will reduce software maintenance and bug-fixing time by 20-30%.

## ‚ú® Use Cases and LOCI added value üöÄ
Why is continuous refactoring a MUST and not an Option? 
Why include refactoring and optimization techniques in the product roadmap for every sprint?


## Fulfill Quality and Compliance requirements 
The delivery is at risk because the source code is not bug-free and does not comply with different industry quality standards.

LOCI added value for the customer by enabling the developers in the early development stage to prepare the code for compliance with safety and security requirements (ISO 26262, ISO/SAE 21434, MISRA, CERT, etc.). 
As a result, the product is ready for customers as planned and with reduced risks.

LOCI capabilities:

Redundant code cleaning: Identify similar segments in multiple Repos and advise how to cleanse cloned code and refactor redundant segments

Ensuring Code Compliance: Updating the code to align with new standards or technologies, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, or adhering to new security policies.


## Implement NON-functional requirements at customer request
The non-functional requirements are more relevant for a product Homologation than the number of features delivered; therefore, this type of requirement will always be mandatory. 

Examples: performance KPIs, efficient usage of resources, customer safety and security, cost saving, and sustainability.

LOCI added value for the customer by increasing performance with less code to execute, providing a safety and security enabler for developers to stop error propagation in the chain, and reducing FTTI, Fault Tolerant Time Interval, and incident response time.

LOCI capabilities for Embedded Systems: optimize the code for the best memory and execution performance

Improved Performance: Altering algorithms or improving data structures to boost the performance of the software

Increased Hardware Lifespan: Reduced binary and efficient resource usage results in less system friction and longer hardware lifetime.

Sustainability: less battery consumption, better device network usage, reduced latency, better-controlled task schedule, and efficient memory management.


## Troubleshoot, Maintenance and Customer Support

API or third-party libraries, bugs identified post-release, and introducing Change Requests are mandatory Maintenance activities that every SW provider would like to do as fast as possible so that the focus stays on the new features of the new platform or product.

Fast and accurate answers to customer questions are not only a contractual duty but also reputation and brand protection.

LOCI added value for the customer by providing fast troubleshooting in a local and distributed development environment and enabling risk assessment before the Change Request is accepted.

LOCI capabilities:
Improving Code Readability: Making the code easier for others (or for you in the future) to read and understand is crucial for teams and long-term projects.

Reducing Complexity: Breaking down complex code blocks into simpler, smaller units that are easier to manage, test & debug.

Identifying and Fixing Bugs: It is common to find and correct hidden or subtle bugs in the code during the refactoring process.

## Reuse the current architecture and the source code in the next platform generation

Unresolved technical debts, inherited from one sprint to another, make the current platform difficult or even impossible to reuse for the next generation.

LOCI added value for the customer: an enabler for reducing the source code complexity making it reusable for the next platform generation.

Optimizing Software Design: Enhancing the software design after initial development due to a better understanding of the problem or changes in requirements.

Preparing the Code for Extensions: Refactoring can help reorganize the code to accommodate new features or updates without a major overhaul.
