## ‚ú® Use Cases and LOCI addeed value üöÄ
Why continuous Refactoring is a MUST and not an Option? 
Why including refactoring and optimization techniques in the product Roadmap, every sprint?


## Fulfill Quality and Compliance mandatory requirements 
The delivery is at risk because the source code is not bug free and is not compliant with industry quality standards.

LOCI added value for customer: enables the developers in early development stage to prepare the code for compliance with safety and security requirements (ISO 26262, ISO/SAE 21434, MISRA, CERT, etc.). 
As a result, the product is ready for customer as planned and with reduced risks.

LOCI capabilities:

Redundant code cleaning: Identify similar segment in multiple Repos and advices how to cleanse cloned code and refactor redundant segments

Ensuring Code Compliance: Updating the code to align with new standards or technologies, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, or adhering to new security policies.


## Implement NON-functional requirements at customer request
The non functional requirements are relevant for a product Homologation, more than the number of features delivered, therefore, this type of requirements will always be mandatory. 

Example: performance KPIs, efficient usage of resources, customer safety and security, cost saving, sustainability.

LOCI added value for customer: increased performance with less code to execute, safety and security enabler for developers to stop the error propagation in chain, reduced FTTI (Fault Tolerant Time Interval), reduced incident response time.

LOCI capabilities for Embeedded Systems: optimize the code for the best memory and execution performance

Improved Performance: Altering algorithms or improving data structures to boost the performance of the software

Increased Hardware Lifespan: reduced binary and efficient usage of resources concludes with less system friction and longer hardware lifetime.

Sustainability: less battery consumption and better vehicle network usage with reduced latency, better controlled task schedule and efficient memory management.


## Troubleshoot, Maintenance and Customer Support

API or 3rd party libraries, bugs identified post release, introducing Change Requests are mandatory Maintenance activities that every SW provider would like to do as fast as possible so that the focus stays with new features of the new platform or a new product.

Fast and accurate answers to customer questions is not only contractual duty, but also reputation and brand protection.

LOCI added value for customer: fast troubleshooting in local and distributed development environment; enabler for risk assessment before the Change Request is accepted.

LOCI capabilities:
Improving Code Readability: Making the code easier to read and understand by others (or by you in the future), which is crucial for teams and long-term projects.

Reducing Complexity: Breaking down complex code blocks into simpler, smaller units that are easier to manage, test & debug.

Identifying and Fixing Bugs: During the refactoring process, it's common to find and correct hidden or subtle bugs in the code that were not evident before.

## Reuse the current architecture and the source code in the next platform generation

Unresolved technical debts, inherited from one sprint to another, make the current platform hard or even impossible to be reused for next generation.

LOCI added value for customer: enabler for reducing the source code complexity making it reusable for next platform generation.


LOCI capabilities:

Optimizing Software Design: Enhancing the software design after initial development due to better understanding of the problem or changes in requirements.

Preparing the Code for Extensions: Refactoring can help in reorganizing the code to accommodate new features or updates without a major overhaul.
